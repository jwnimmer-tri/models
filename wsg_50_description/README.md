# Schunk WSG meshes

This folder contains a model of the Schunk WSG 50 gripper.

The files were originally taken from the WSG 50 ROS package
https://code.google.com/p/wsg50-ros-pkg as of an unknown commit.
That repository was shared under the BSD-3-Clause license terms.

Drake used meshlab to convert the original STL meshes to the OBJ format.
